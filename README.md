# Birds Classifier



## Problem Description

Train a network model to classify/predict bird species for the [bird classification Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birds23sp)

## Datasets

I used the Kaggle datasets provided on the challenge website, which include 38562 images (555 classes) for training and 10000 images for testing.

## Pre-existing Work

This project builds upon the [iPynb - Transfer Learning to Birds](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kHo8VT-onDxbtS3FM77VImG35h_K_Lav?usp=sharing) class tutorial and uses PyTorch framework. I used [ResNet50](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.resnet50.html) as a pretrained model.

## Approach

```python
import os
```

## Discussion

What problems did you encounter?
* One of the problems that I encountered was the runtime of my model. Because it took pretty long to run even on GPU (~2-3h/run), it was time-consuming to experiment with different hyperparameters or just tweak the model a bit.

Are there next steps you would take if you kept working on the project?

How does your approach differ from others? Was that beneficial?
